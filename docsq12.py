# Q12.Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

# They might be fun in your world, but not here.

# Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

# 1450 -> 145
# 960000 -> 96
# 1050 -> 105
# -1050 -> -105

# def zero():
#         a=[1450,960000,1050,10500]
#         i=0
#         b=[]
#         while i<len(a):
#                 while a[i]>0:
#                         if a[i]%10!=0:
#                                 b.append(a[i])
#                                 break
#                         a[i]//=10
#                 i+=1
#         print(b)
# zero()
